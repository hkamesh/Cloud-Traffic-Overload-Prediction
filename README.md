# Cloud Traffic Overload Prediction

This project simulates cloud traffic behavior and uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict traffic overload based on various performance metrics like CPU load, memory usage, and network latency.

## 📁 File Structure

- `mlt.py`: Main Python script for data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `cloud_traffic_data.csv`: Synthetic dataset generated by the script.

## ⚙️ Features

- Generates a synthetic dataset simulating cloud metrics.
- Performs exploratory data analysis using Seaborn.
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualizes feature importance and confusion matrix.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The generated dataset contains the following features:

- `Disk_Usage` (%)
- `Memory_Usage` (%)
- `CPU_Load` (%)
- `Network_Latency` (ms)
- `Temperature` (°C)
- `Traffic_Overload`: Target variable (0 = Normal, 1 = Overloaded)

## 🧠 Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python mlt.py
   ```

3. Output includes:
   - Dataset creation message
   - Accuracy of the model
   - Confusion matrix and classification report
   - Plots: pairplot, confusion matrix heatmap, feature importances

## 📌 Notes

- This is a synthetic project meant for learning machine learning workflows.
- Modify the dataset generation to mimic real-world cloud environments more closely.

## 📷 Sample Outputs

- Confusion Matrix Heatmap
- Feature Importance Bar Chart
- Pairplot of Dataset
